Face recognition plays a crucial role in video surveillance, access control systems, and forensic. Although numerous techniques exist for face recognition, they are limited to both a controlled environment and plenty of training data, especially for recognition in large datasets. In addition, increasing the number of identities in the dataset hardens the computational complexity of recognition. To address these problems, a framework is proposed in this paper that employs hashing functions for feature extraction in face recognition.
We evaluated the performance of the proposed method on the FERET, ORL, and AR datasets. It is witnessed that our method improves the recognition rate and significantly reduces the computational complexity of face recognition.
This paper was sent to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing Journal and after publication, I will put the entire code. For now, I just have prepared an application to show the recognition step of our method at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fwuexmevandd49s/AABirrubOXbG5yHUZD3SbZT0a?dl=0.
